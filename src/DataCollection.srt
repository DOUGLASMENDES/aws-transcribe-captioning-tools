00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,529
Hello, Statistic body. I'm yoga. Welcome to

2
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:21,510
competition. All statistic subject. Okay, in this

3
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:32,600
section I will tell you about data collection, the

4
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:39,299
objectives off the session, our definition off data types

5
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:45,579
, off data primary and secondary data and the last

6
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:53,719
IHS data collection techniques. Okay, Now I start

7
00:00:53,729 --> 00:01:00,490
from definition off data, as we know from the

8
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:06,930
previous chapter that statistics is important and closely related to

9
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,269
data. Now, I will explain about the definition

10
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,200
off data itself. In definition one, data are

11
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,200
plain facts usually roll numbers and in the definition to

12
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:30,140
data are individual pieces off, factual information recorded and

13
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:37,000
used for the purpose off analysis. So from the

14
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,969
two definitions, we know that data is the part

15
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:49,319
off information. Now, I will explain about types

16
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:56,659
off data data is divided into two kinds, namely

17
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:08,120
qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative data itself is divided into

18
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:15,650
nominal and or denial for quantitative is defected into inter

19
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:21,680
file and rescue each off. The inter fall and

20
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:32,370
rescue have discrete data and continuous data. Okay,

21
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:37,960
Now I will explain more detail about the types off

22
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:43,939
data. Qualitative. Okay. Qualitative is a data

23
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:49,469
concerned with descriptions which can be observed but cannot be

24
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:55,969
computed. And as we know, that qualitative data

25
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:02,050
is divided into nominal an orginal scale. No,

26
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:07,840
I will explain about the nominal scale nominal scale called

27
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,449
simply because levels you can check the examples below to

28
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:27,259
understand what the nominal is now for the orginal scale

29
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:30,990
, the orginal scale have order off the values.

30
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:37,979
The order is important and significant, but the differences

31
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:44,020
between each one is not really known. And you

32
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:53,840
can see the example below. Okay. Now its

33
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:01,569
quantitative quantitative is the one that focus on numbers and

34
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:10,159
mathematical calculations and can be calculated and computed and quantitative

35
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,529
. Uh huh. Toe rescue. The first is

36
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:23,839
interval scale and interval skills are numbering skills in which

37
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:28,209
we know both the order and the exact differences between

38
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:33,129
the values and second is ratio skills. Raise your

39
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:39,709
skills are data measurement skills because they tell us about

40
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:43,589
the order. They tell us the exact value between

41
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:47,949
units, and they also have a new absolute zero

42
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:54,930
, which allows for a wide range off both descriptive

43
00:04:54,939 --> 00:05:00,829
and inferential statistics to be applied now I will explain

44
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:11,980
about discrete and continuous data for discrete data can only

45
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:19,629
take certain values. And that's the example, the

46
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:26,850
number off student and the number that appear after you

47
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:40,860
rolling dies and continuous data for continuous data can take

48
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:46,699
any value within a range. And the examples are

49
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:51,930
the first is a person's hey and then the time

50
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:58,050
in a race. And then a talks waked and

51
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:05,930
the length off a leaf. No, If there's

52
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:15,230
a question how we to get the data, the

53
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:20,750
answer is they're too option to get data. First

54
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:27,089
is get the data by ourselves. For example,

55
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,160
a researcher conduct some research, and he gathered the

56
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,730
data by himself. We called the data as primary

57
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:42,790
data. Second is Katie data from another source.

58
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,259
For example, I collect the data from Internet or

59
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:49,769
I ask my fellow researcher to give his data.

60
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:54,769
The data that I get is called secondary data,

61
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:01,680
and there are many techniques to get the data.

62
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:05,089
But in this session I only mentioned five techniques,

63
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:14,649
namely, record station senses, survey experiment and observation

64
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:24,560
. Registration is a method which in places more on

65
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:35,610
structured recording through various institutions, and census is a

66
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:42,060
complete way off collecting data where all elements in the

67
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,800
population that are object off the research are investigated or

68
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:56,889
enumerated one by one. And then the next ISS

69
00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:01,300
survey survey is collecting information from a sample group to

70
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:09,649
learn about the entire population and next ISS experiment.

71
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:16,930
An experimental study has the researcher purposely attempting to influence

72
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:20,939
the result. The goal is to do their mind

73
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:26,550
what effect a particular treatment has on the outcome.

74
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:33,570
Researchers take measurements or surface off the sample population,

75
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:46,169
and you can read the example below. No,

76
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:52,710
the observational in the observational study, the simple population

77
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,529
being studied ISS miserable or surveilled as it ISS.

78
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:05,879
The researcher observes the subjects and missiles variables but doesn't

79
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,779
influence the population in any way or attempt to intervene

80
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,990
in the study. There is no manipulation by the

81
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:20,659
researcher, and the last is that those that we

82
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:26,480
can use to collect the data. You can use

83
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:33,049
questionnaire in their view checklist or any digital tools.

84
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:41,110
Okay, I think enough for the session. I

85
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:45,769
hope you enjoy that. And CIA
